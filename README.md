# Campus Bridge

## Project Title
Campus Bridge â€“ Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

## Selected Domain
Education Technology (EdTech) and Learning Management Systems

## Problem Statement / Use Case
The modern educational landscape requires a unified platform that can seamlessly integrate academic learning with practical coding skill development. Current solutions often separate these two crucial aspects of education, leading to fragmented learning experiences and inefficient skill development. There is a need for a comprehensive platform that bridges this gap, providing students with a cohesive environment for both academic learning and coding practice.

## Abstract / Problem Description
Campus Bridge addresses the critical need for an integrated learning environment that combines academic course management with practical coding skill development. The platform serves as a unified solution for universities, offering a Learning Management System (LMS) for academic courses alongside a robust coding development environment. Key features include real-time code assistance, collaborative programming spaces, and AI-powered learning tools. The system aims to enhance student engagement, improve learning outcomes, and prepare students for both academic success and professional careers in technology. By integrating these traditionally separate domains, Campus Bridge provides a more efficient, engaging, and effective learning experience for modern students.
